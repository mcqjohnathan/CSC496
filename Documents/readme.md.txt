 My Computer is 4-5 years old. I assumed you wanted the graphs from the MSI Aterburner so there in the files for each game.
  My first game was Gears 5. All i did was start the benchmark thats in the extras tab in the main menu then started MSI AfterBurner. When the benchmark ended i stopped the MSI program also and collected the data. My settings for gears 5 should be in the Gears5 file.


  I think the data shows that my computer can run these games at a good setting
