My computer Stats:
1070 Founders Edition
Intel Core i7-6700k
16GB Memory
ASROCK Z170 Gaming-ITX/ac
 My Computer is 4-5 years old.
  My first game was Gears 5. All i did was start the benchmark thats in the extras tab in the main menu then started MSI AfterBurner. 
  When the benchmark ended i stopped the MSI program also and collected the data. My settings for gears 5 should be in the Gears5 file
  but they all are maxed out. My second game is Civilization 6. I ran the AI benchmark in the menu and collected my data that way. 
  The settings were all maxed out with both performance and memory set to high. The third game i did was TotalwarSagaTroy 
  i ran the game on high and did the battle benchmark then ran the game on medium and did the battle benchmrk also.


  I think the data shows that my computer can run these games at a good setting with optimal framerate.Troy used the most 
  CPU out of all the games. But also had the highest framerate. On the gears5 MSI wasnt picking up the frametime for some reason. 
  Putting troy on medium made the framerate go up by double. And the frametimes avg go up a bit.
